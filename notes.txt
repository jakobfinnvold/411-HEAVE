Finding equivalent inertia. J_hat, combine all inertias till u get mass*acc = sum of forces
Newtons equations - acc to one side. acc drum = gb*acc_motor. 

drum frictoin + drag force = b
linearlize drag around a point - how big is drag compered to friction at motor/drum. Neglect?
b drum to motor side. Assumption here -> disregard drag.
